        <p class="h3 heading-abt">Welcome to Seb's – Where Music Comes to Life!</p>
        <p class="p-3 heading-abt">
            Welcome to Seb’s, a soulful sanctuary in the heart of Manhattan, where the smooth rhythms of jazz meet the vibrant energy of the city.
            Founded in 2024, our club is dedicated to creating an intimate space where music, culture, and community come together in harmony.
        </p>
        <p class="h3 heading-abt">Our Story</p>
        <p class="p-3 heading-abt">
            Seb’s was born out of a deep passion for jazz and a commitment to preserving its legacy while embracing the evolving sounds of today. 
            Founded by a group of musicians, music lovers, and visionaries, our mission is simple: to offer a place where great jazz can be experienced
            up close and personal, and where every note played is a tribute to the rich history of this timeless genre.

            We chose to open our doors in Manhattan, a city that has long been a beacon of musical innovation, because we believe the energy of this dynamic
            city is the perfect backdrop for the magic of live jazz. Whether you’re a lifelong fan of the genre or a newcomer discovering the rhythms for
            the first time, Seb’s is where music speaks to the soul.
        </p>

            hottest up-and-coming artists, you’ll hear it all here.

            But the music is just the beginning. Our expertly curated cocktail menu and thoughtfully selected wine list are designed to complement the sounds, 
            with options that range from classic concoctions to innovative creations inspired by the spirit of jazz itself. We also offer a selection of light 
            bites, perfect for pairing with your favorite tune.
